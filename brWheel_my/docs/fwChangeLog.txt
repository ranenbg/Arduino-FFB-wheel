Changes from fw-v24X to fw-v250

- added 2 FFB axis feature (firmware option "b")
- firmware has 2 FFB axis in HID and 2 channel PWM+- outputs (new PWM mode available - with 4 PWM outputs)
- 2nd channel PWM+- output is on pins D5 and D11 (timers 1 and 3 are utilized)
- one mode available for 2 channel PWM+- output (only 2CH PWM+-, for now)
- frequency and PWM type adjustments are available for 2CH PWM+- mode
- restructured firmware to allow 2 FFB axis feature (2D vector structs and pointers are used for xy-axis, xy-FFB and xy-PWM)
- optimized code when using 1 FFB axis (vector structs become 1D - saving some program memory)
- 2 axis FFB feature is available only for following FFB effects: constant, spring and periodic sine (more effects may be supported if required)
- as before, following FFB effects are only available on x-FFB axis: ramp, damper, inertia, friction and all remaining periodic (square, triangle, sawtoothup and sawtoothdown)
- added conditional block effects for 2nd FFB axis (used for spring effect only, for now)
- removed deadband from conditional effect block for spring (due to program memory limitation)
- disabled deadband for all remaining conditional FFB effects: spring, damper, inertia and friction (commented out in firmware, but can be reused if enough memory is left)
- available conditional block effects are: offset, positive coefficient and axis parameter block (no deadband, no negative coefficient, no negative/positive saturation)
- added firmware option "d" where optical quadrature encoder support is disabled (you may comment out usage of quad enc in Config.h)
- if no optical or magnetic encoders are used, x-axis is using analog input from z-axis (making it unavailable - half axis range is permanently set for z-axis)
- added endstop spring force for yFFB axis (with the same strength as for xFFB)
- endstop force for both FFB axis now starts slightly before axis ends (moved inwards by 1/64 of total axis range)
- changed default PWM settings to: fast pwm, pwm+-, 8kHz (optimal settings for H-bridge motor drivers like BTS7960 -> higher PWM resolution -> higher FFB fidelity)
- restructured part of firmware code for axis (their calibration) and ffb axis, by implementing usage of structs and pointers (some more program memory is free)
- changed how firmware version is interpreted (all 3 digits are representing firmware version and everything else will be a firmware option)
- added a few new firmware options ("d", "n", "l", "g", "p" see GitHub readme for description of each option)
- added 2 channel equivalents for remaining pwm modes (2CH PWM+DIR, 2CH PWM0-50-100 and 2CH RCM) 
- 2CH RCM pwm mode is commented out in firmware to save some program memory (it's rarely used)
- serial (CDC) and HID configuration interface are now options in Config.h that may be commented out (configCDC is used by GUI, configHID is commented out or unused for now)
- started implementing firmware configuration by native HID protocol (plan is to replace configCDC completely with configHID at some point)
- implemented support for hardware re-center button when magnetic encoder is used, if no optical encoder is used (center button is re-mapped to TX pin instead of D2)
- updated wirings, docs and manuals with new firmware features

Changes from fw-v250 to fw-v250x

- uncommented usage of trigger repeat interval and trigger buttons items in the struct for ffb effects (fix for non working FFB effects with non-infinite duration)

Changes from fw-v250x to fw-v250xnr

- added support for i2C multiplexer chip TCA9548A (new firmware option "u")
- added support for using two AS5600 magnetic encoders
- 2nd magnetic encoder is on y-axis only and is used as input for yFFB
- added vector struct for scaled x- and y-axis for USB send report
- changing CPR and rotation angle affects both magnetic encoders in the same way (angle from x-axis before change is copied to y-axis)
- center button (both software and hardware) return both magnetic encoders to zero axis value
- encoder calibration is only done for x-axis (even if 2 FFB axis and two magnetic encoders are used)
- added full support for shift register chips SN74ALS166N or SN74HC165N, for 24 buttons with 3 stacked chips (options "n" + "r")
- created wiring diagram for shift register chips (options "n" + "r")
- created wiring diagram for double AS5600 (options "b" + "w" + "u")
- removed following 2CH PWM modes: PWM+DIR, PWM0-50-100 and RCM to free up memory when 2 magnetic encoders (AS5600) are used, 2CH PWM+- mode is still available (only for firmware options "b" + "w" + "u")
- compiled additional firmware HEX combinations utilizing newly available features
