This txt file contains a list of all available RS232 serial interface commands implemented in my latest Arduino Leonardo FFB wheel firmware version (you can use this info to make your own control GUI)

Arduino boards are also recognized as a virtual serial communication device (COM port) through which we can send/receive commands to/from the ATmega32U4 microcontroller

RS232,   commands are not case sensitive (in this manual capital letters are used only as an example)
         some commands do not have any parameter following a command char, but if they do, a range of available input values is given
         all commands must be terminated with CR: carriage return - char(13)
         upon receiving valid command Arduino terminates all responses with CR+LF: carriage return - char(13) and line feed - char(10)
         some commands have response and some don't (in this txt file, null means no serial response from Arduino)
         most commands can apply changes right away, but some require Arduino restart (for PWM settings - reconfiguration of internal timer registers is necessary)
         if Arduino restart is needed, do not send any additional commands before restart
         firmware will check if any serial command is received every 10ms (100Hz refresh rate)
         Arduino response time is therefore maximally 10ms, but typically is around (2-5)ms
         at each Arduino powerup firmware will automatically load and configure all settings from EEPROM (for load cell - it takes additional 2s for completing tare zeroing)
         FFB clip LED will quickly blink 3 times to indicate that everything is loaded, configured and ready to use

versions, I have put some logic in firmware naming, so here is some basic explanation (if you plan to upgrade firmware, please respect this):
         fw-vXX,  two digits only are a test versions of new firmware features (not used anymore)
         fw-vXX0, three digits ending with 0 - the basic firmware with no external devices support, except for optical/magnetic encoder (has PWM signal as FFB output)
         fw-vXX1, three digits ending with 1 - adds support for external button box
         fw-vXX2, three digits ending with 2 - adds support for both external button box and load cell
         fw-vXX3, three digits ending with 3 - adds support for external button box, load cell and two external 12bit DAC - MCP4725 (has analog signal as FFB output)

options, firmware version may include some letters after 3rd digit, their meaning is:
         a - pedal autocalibration enabled (if no a, then manual calibration is enabled)
	 w - magnetic encoder AS5600 support
         z - optical encoder with z-index support
         h - enabled Hat Switch (uses first 4 buttons from button box)
         s - enabled external 12bit ADC - ADS1015 (for analog inputs)
         t - enabled 4x4 button matrix
         f - enabled XY analog H-pattern shifter
         i - enabled averaging of analog inputs
	 e - support for two additional digital buttons (clutch and handbrake axis will be unavailable)
	 x - enables the option to select to which (analog) axis is FFB tied to
         m - replacement pinouts for ProMicro (for FFB clipping LED, buttons 3 and 4, PWM direction pin)

[1] all wheel parameters read out
received numbers are: wheel rotation angle, general, damper, friction, constant, 
periodic, spring, inertia, auto center spring and end stop spring effect gains,
min torque PWM, brake pressure, desktop effects byte, total PWM steps (resolution), encoder CPR and PWM configuration byte

2 - calibration error
command		example response
S		1			

[4] re-calibrate wheel
this feature has two modes of operation depending on firmware option "z"
(a)for firmware without "z" option, this procedure will try to rotate wheel to the right until a mechanical end stop is detected
do not use this command if you do not have a mechanical limits for wheel rotation installed (should use center command instead)
(b)for firmware with "z" option, this procedure will rotate the wheel until a z-index pulse from encoder is detected
at this position of z-index, a 0deg value will be assigned to the wheel (this may not be a real wheel zero angle)
if a wheel is not centered at this position (99% chance), return the wheel by hand to the center, then send "center" command, then send "save" command to save new z-index offset value
this procedure will store the z-index pulse angle offset in EEPROM 
on next Arduino powerup as soon as z-index is detected, the firmware will automatically apply the angle correction using the offset loaded from EEPROM
note that z-index angle offset will change if you re-mount your encoder, as you are not able to put it back to the exact same angle mechanically
command		example response
R		null

[5] adjust load cell brake pressure calibration factor (valid for fw-vXX2 only, for all other it becomes a *PWM balance slider)
sent and received number is only a relative value
each load cell will have a different max force
value of 4 will give 1:1 reading from HX711 24bit ADC chip
*PWM balance slider - you can use it to compensate for example if your motor has a stronger pull in one direction (128-center, equal pull in both directions)
value	leftPWM(%)	rightPWM (%)
0	100    		50
128	100		100
255	50		100
command		example response	range
B 45		1			1-255

[6] re-calibrate pedals
will reset pedal axis auto-calibration
if load cell is used for brake it will not affect its calibration factor and will only reset throttle and clutch
if no load cell is used reset will be done for brake axis as well
command		example response	range
P		1			null

[7] optical encoder CPR (PPR) adjustment
sent and received number is CPR - counts per revolution of encoder shaft (valid for optical, magnetic encoders and pots)
encoders usualy have specified PPR - pulses per revolution
CPR = 4 * PPR * X
X=1 if encoder is directly mounted to the wheel rim, otherwise it is a gear ratio between encoder and wheel shafts
if a pot is used for X-axis then CPR is tied to resolution of that analog input (Arduino 10bit 1024, with averaging 4096, or with ADS1105 in single ended readout 2048)
command		example response	range
O 2400		1			4-600000


[8] re-center wheel
use this command to reset 0deg position of your wheel rim (after you manually centering the wheel)
this will be required each time Arduino is powered on or reset, but it's very quick and easy to do
for HEX firmware with "z" option enabled, it will set z-index offset in the units of encoder CPR
command		example response	range
C		1			null

[9] reset encoder Z-index
use this command to set the Z-index encoder offset value to 0
after using this command you can move the wheel to a new position and press the center, than press save button
command		example response	range
Z		1			null

bit0 - is LSB (lowest significant bit)
sent and received number is a decimal equivalent (form) of this byte

[12] adjust PWM settings - requires Arduino restart in order to apply changes (press reset button, or just re-plug Arduino to USB port)
byte, bit0-phase correct (or fast mode), bit1-dir enabled (or PWM+-), bits 2-5 are frequency select, bits6-pwm0.50.100 mode enable, bit7 is unused
PWM0.50.100. mode selection is done by setting bit1 LOW and bit6 HIGH
RCM mode selection is done by setting both bit1 and bit6 HIGH (please note that not all frequencies are available, see firmware_info.txt for more details)

bit0 pwm_type
0    fast pwm
1    phase correct

bit1 bit6 pwm_mode
0    0    pwm+-
0    1    pwm0.50.100
1    0    pwm+dir
1    1    rcm

for available frequency selection see firmware info.txt
