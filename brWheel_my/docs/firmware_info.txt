This txt file contains full details about Arduino FFB wheel firmware capabilities and features:

Supported Arduino boards - Leonardo, Micro or ProMicro (5V, 16MHz clock)

firmware	PWM freq	PWM mode	PWM res		steering	brake		throttle	clutch		handbrake	buttons		HAT Switch	XYshifter

ver24X		16KHz*		PWM+-*		500*		16bit	        16bit(LC,a,s)	12bit(a,s)	12bit(a,s)	12bit(a,s)	24(16 used)	1		10bit

*fully configurable through RS232 or Wheel control v2.6.1

LC - load cell module HX711 24bit, 1 sample no-averaging, limited by Microsoft FFB driver to 16bits (0-65535)
a - Arduino analog input, 10bit (0-1023)
s - ADS1015, external ADC, 12bit (0-4095)
**HID supports total of 28 buttons, but only 24 buttons are visible, because 4 buttons are reserved for D-pad (HAT switch) 
firmware is compatible with any Thrustmaster wheel rim at 3.3v
be careful! 5V to 3.3V logic level converter is needed from Arduino wheel base board to Thrustmaster wheel rim
first 6 buttons are reserved for recognition of Thrustmaster wheel rims
Leonardo, Micro or ProMicro - up to 8 buttons are available on the main Arduino board (may be less depending on firmware options)
With external Arduino Nano board acting as a button box, up to 16 buttons can be used (button box firmware included in a separate *.ino file)

Axis readout adjustment (LC, a, s) and auto calibration (on/off) - requires recompiling

Available sensors on X-axis (for steering, tied to FFB axis):
[1] Optical encoder - quadrature readout of two channels, 1k-10k pullup resistors optional, available CPR range in firmware depends on selected deg of rotation (DOR), the limitation is CPR*DOR/360 <= 600k
[2] Magnetic encoder - 12bit i2C AS5600 (default CPR=4096, set to full precision and 2.2ms response time, multiturn detection supported)
[3] Potentiometer - any linear pot 10k-100k Ohm

USB poll. rate	FFB calc. rate	RS232 refresh	RS232 baud rate		axis update rate	LC update rate		buttons,D-pad,XY_shifter update rate
