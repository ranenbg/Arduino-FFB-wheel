This txt file contains details about Arduino FFB wheel firmware capabilities and features:

Supported Arduino boards - Leonardo, Micro or ProMicro (5V, 16MHz clock)

firmware	pwm freq	pwm mode	pwm res		steering	brake		throttle	clutch		handbrake	buttons		HAT Switch	XYshifter

ver22x		16KHz*		pwm+-*		500*		16bit	        16bit(LC,a,s)	12bit(a,s)	12bit(a,s)	12bit(a,s)	24(16 used)	1		10bit

*fully configurable through RS232 or Wheel control v2.5

LC - load cell module HX711 24bit for brake, 2 samples runing average, (0-65535, limited by microsoft FFB driver to 16bits max)
a - Arduino analog input, 10bit (0-1023)
s - ADS1105, external ADC, 12bit (0-4095)
**HID supports total of 28 buttons, but only 24 buttons are visible, because 4 buttons are reserved for HAT Switch
firmware is compatible with any thrustmaster wheel rim at 3.3v
be careful! 5V to 3.3V logic level converter is needed from Arduino wheel base board to Thrustmaster wheel rim
first 6 buttons are reserved for recognition of thrustmaster wheel rims
Leonardo, Micro or ProMicro - only up to 2 buttons are available on the main Arduino board (due to no more pins left)
Nano - with external Arduino Nano board acting as button box, up to 16 buttons can be used (button box firmware is inlcuded in separate *.ino file)

Axis readout adjustment (LC, a, s) and auto calibration (on/off) - requires recompiling

Optical encoder: two channels, 3.3k pullup resistors optional, CPR range which firmware support depends on selected deg of rotation. The limitation is that CPR*deg_rot/360 must be equal or less than 600000 

USB poll. rate	FFB calc. rate	RS232 refresh	RS232 baud rate		axis update rate	LC update rate		buttons+HAT+XYshifter update rate

500Hz (2ms)	500Hz (2ms)	100Hz (10ms)	115200bit/s		500Hz (2ms)		80Hz (12.5ms)		500Hz (2ms)

Supported FFB effects: constant force, ramp, spring, damper, inertia, friction, sine, triangle, square, sawtoothup, sawtoothdown

FFB mics: all effects are calculated with 16bit; realisticaly calculated damper, inertia and friction; fully working periodic effects;
fully implemented condition and envelope block effects, effect duration, start delay, direction for 2 axis FFB (2nd pwm channel not implemented yet)

Internal FFB effects: auto centering spring, damper, inertia, friction and end stop spring (can be turned on/off through serial interface)

Firmware features: RS232 interface for adjusting all FFB parameters, LC brake pressure, pedal autocalibration, minimal PWM value, rotation angle, recenter wheel,
recalibrate wheel, recalibrate pedals, wheel version info, truning various desktop effects on/off, turn on/off ffb signal monitor, save ffb config to EEPROM,
adjustment of encoder CPR, fully adjustable PWM settings that are stored in EEPROM, FFB clip LED indicator (ligts up gradually from last 10% of FFB signal level),
4x4 button matrix, CPR range up to 100k, wheel angle used as metric for spring, damper, inertia and friction effects, encoder z-index reset

Wheel control GUI: made in Processing 3.5.4, visualises all axis and buttons including serial commands sent and received from Arduino, full adjustment of FFB effect gains,
ffb signal monitor, load/save last settings from EEPROM, recenter wheel, recalibrate pedals, encoder CPR adjustment, pwm adjustment, COM port cfg via dialog,
Axis colors cfg txt, storing/loading FFB parameter profiles to/from PC, autodetection of firmware version, XY analog shifter support, manual pedal axis calibration,
added pwm0.50.100 mode, hardware button wheel re-center, added rcm pwm mode, added z-index reset button, lattest version v2.5

FFB output: fully configurable PWM settings, PWM frequency (tied to PWM resolution), PWM types (phase correct or fast TOP), PWM modes (pwm+-, pwm+dir, pwm0.50.100 or rcm),
changes require restarting Arduino, analog 2ch external 12bit DAC MCP4725 available (requires recompiling)
